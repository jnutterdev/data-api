Simple drum machine and pattern test created with [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/)

Plays kick, clap, and hihhat on an 8 bar loop


- Needs a few more sounds, patterns, and some style
- Needs to reset the loop upon stop, or playback ( pattern seems to continue where left off at the start of playback)
